            [Verse 1: Karen Carpenter]
            Such a feeling's coming over me
            There is wonder in most everything I see
            Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
            And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

            [Verse 2]
            Everything I want the world to be
            Is now coming true especially for me
            And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
            You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

            [Chorus]
            I'm on the top of the             [Verse 1: Karen Carpenter]
            Such a feeling's coming over me
            There is wonder in most everything I see
            Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
            And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

            [Verse 2]
            Everything I want the world to be
            Is now coming true especially for me
            And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
            You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

            [Chorus]
            I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
            And the only explanation I can find
            Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
            Your love's put me at the top of the world

            [Verse 3]
            Something in the wind has learned my name
            And it's telling me that things are not the same
            In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
            There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
